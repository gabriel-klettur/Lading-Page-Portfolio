              About Me
            </h1>
            <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              I am Gabriel, a software developer with a passion for technology, process optimization, and solving complex problems.
              My professional journey has been marked by challenging and diverse experiences that have strengthened both my technical
              and personal skills. Since arriving in Iceland, I have embraced every opportunity as a challenge to prove my ability to
              adapt, learn, and excel in various environments.

              My First Steps in Iceland
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              I began my journey in Sandgerði, working on machinery cleaning at Nyfiskur. This environment allowed me to apply my
              analytical mindset and focus on continuous improvement. I designed diagrams, calculated timings, and optimized every
              step of the cleaning and maintenance process, which eventually led to my promotion as manager of a four-person team.
              There, I developed plans to standardize processes and ensure operational efficiency.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              When COVID-19 forced me to stay in Sandgerði, I discovered the power of patience and ventured into the world of
              investments and trading. Although I faced a challenging start, with negative results during my first two years, I learned
              to survive the markets and develop resilience.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-10">
              Balancing Technical and Personal Projects
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              At the same time, I worked on family projects developing interfaces for environmental analysis companies using Laravel.
              This experience solidified my ability to create tailored solutions while maintaining my passion for software engineering.

              Transition to Reykjavik: New Challenges and Learnings
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Over time, I moved to Reykjavik to explore new opportunities, this time in the culinary field. I started from scratch as
              a dishwasher at CenterHotels, where I learned and quickly grew, advancing to roles such as pastry chef, chef assistant,
              and eventually leading teams as the main chef on various occasions. Again, my inclination for continuous improvement led
              me to document and optimize production processes, facilitating the onboarding of new team members.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Despite being immersed in gastronomy, I never set aside my passion for software. I dedicated time to updating my
              knowledge, learning Python while working as a manager at Babalu Caffe. This balance between continuous learning and
              management allowed me to strengthen both my technical and leadership skills.

              Rediscovering My Vocation
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              In October, I made a crucial decision: to fully dedicate myself to software development and embark on a journey as an
              independent developer. Since then, I have been designing and developing two applications that reflect my learnings and
              experiences in Iceland:

            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-base text-gray-700">
              <li className="mb-2">
                <strong>Pelusa Trader</strong>: An application under development focused on automated trading, designed to optimize
                capital management and investment strategies. This project integrates real-time market analysis and customizable
                tools, showcasing my ability to create technological solutions in the financial field.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Open Gastro</strong>: Currently under construction, this solution aims to improve operational management in
                the restaurant sector, leveraging my practical knowledge in cooking and administration to provide tools that
                streamline daily processes for restaurants.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-6 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Both projects not only represent my evolution as a professional but also my commitment to technical excellence. As I
              develop these applications, I continue to expand my skills in modern technologies and apply the insights gained
              throughout my journey.

              My Philosophy
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
              Every experience in my career has been an opportunity to grow, learn, and add value. My ability to adapt to new
              environments, face challenges, and find creative solutions makes me a versatile software developer, ready to tackle
              complex projects with determination and professionalism.
